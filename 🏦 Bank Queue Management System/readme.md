## 🏦 Bank Queue Management System

This project simulates a **real-world bank ticketing system** using the **Queue data structure** in C++. The system models how multiple cashiers handle customers based on their **ticket numbers and gender**.

### 💡 Key Features

* Implements **OOP design** with classes for `Bank`, `Cashier`, and `Customer`.
* Supports **4 cashiers** 2 for male customers and 2 for female customers.
* Dynamically generates unique ticket numbers (e.g., `M100`, `F200`, etc.).
* Efficient queue handling for real-world simulation of customer flow.
* Clean and readable code structure focusing on **real-world modeling**.

### 🧩 Concepts Practiced

* Queue Data Structure
* Object-Oriented Programming (Encapsulation, Composition)
* Real-world Problem Modeling
